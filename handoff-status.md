# Talentrah — Handoff Status

Single-file record of what has shipped and how it was verified. Kept current
after every merge, so state is reconstructable from this file alone.

## Verification standard

This project has been burned by reported-but-untrue merge claims. The standard
now is: **a merge is not confirmed until it has been checked by a method a
second party could reproduce, against live state.** For every merge recorded
below that means all four of:

1. `GET /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:n` reporting `merged: true` with a
   `merged_at` and `merge_commit_sha`.
2. A **fresh shallow clone** of `main` — not the local working copy, which can
   be stale or dirty — with the expected files asserted present.
3. Where the change is observable from outside, a **live production probe**.
4. The full test suite run against merged `main`.

Un-pinned `raw.githubusercontent.com` fetches and cached GitHub web pages have
both served stale content in this project's history. Don't rely on either.

## Merged 2026-08-25 — PRs #35, #36, #37

All three verified by the four-step standard above.

| PR | Branch | Merged at (UTC) | Merge SHA |
|----|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| [#37](https://github.com/Bayo-1987/Claude-Talentrah/pull/37) | `fix/api-contract-layer` | 14:48:38 | `b605435` |
| [#36](https://github.com/Bayo-1987/Claude-Talentrah/pull/36) | `fix/tracker-stage-transitions` | 14:54:50 | `66edb12` |
| [#35](https://github.com/Bayo-1987/Claude-Talentrah/pull/35) | `fix/referral-self-referral-dots` | 14:57:35 | `61fc8db` |

Merged **#37 first**, out of the suggested #35 → #36 → #37 order, for two
reasons: its exposure was live and unauthenticated, and its regenerated
`src/lib/supabase/types.ts` is a strict superset of #35's, so landing it first
turned a hand-merge into a `--theirs` take.

### PR #37 — API contract layer

Closed a **live, unauthenticated production exposure**. Verified open
immediately before the merge and closed immediately after:

```
before   GET  /api/admin/moderate-scholarship          -> 200  (full pending queue)
         POST /api/admin/estimate-llm-costs?group=bogus -> 400  (validation, not auth)

after    GET  /api/admin/moderate-scholarship          -> 401  {"error":"Unauthorized"}
         GET  /api/admin/ingest-scholarships            -> 401
         GET  /api/admin/ingest-jobs                    -> 401
         GET  /api/admin/renew-passes                   -> 401
         POST /api/admin/estimate-llm-costs?group=bogus -> 401
```

The `400 → 401` inversion on the last one is the specific proof the guard now
runs *before* argument validation, rather than being skipped.

Public surface re-checked for a 0032-style regression: `/` 200, `/login` 200,
`/signup` 200, `/jobs` 307 → `/login` (the normal auth gate, not breakage).

Also in #37: atomic per-user rate limiting on `/api/tailoring` and
`/api/resume/parse` (migration `0038`), no handler returning raw `err.message`,
a guard on `request.formData()`, and job ingestion finally scheduled
(`0 5 * * *`).

### PR #36 — tracker stage transitions

Migration `0037`. `hired → anything but archived` is now a database trigger,
because `applications` carries a permissive owner-only policy that makes an
app-layer check bypassable. Also adds the shared retrying auth-test helper
(`tests/support/auth.ts`) and the missing cross-user UPDATE tests.

### PR #35 — self-referral via dotted Gmail aliases

Migration `0036`. Dots are stripped for `gmail.com`/`googlemail.com` only,
since other providers treat them as significant.

### Conflicts resolved during the merges

- `tests/rls/org-and-referral-scoping.test.ts` (#36 ↔ #37): both branches had
  **independently found and fixed the same fixture bug** — its `.limit(1)` had
  started selecting a real unverified org's posting, so the suite reported
  0027's verification gate working correctly as a regression. Identical code
  fix on both sides; kept #36's fuller comment and dropped #37's duplicate.
- `src/lib/supabase/types.ts` (#35 ↔ #37): both regenerated it. Took `main`'s
  copy wholesale after asserting it is a superset — `normalize_email_for_self_referral`,
  `org_application_counts`, `consume_rate_limit`, `spend_credits_atomic`,
  `auto_apply_claim_submission` and the rest all present.

### Correction to the incoming backlog

The backlog described all three PRs as green. **#35 was not.** Its
"Typecheck, lint, unit tests" check had *failed* and Playwright was skipped as
a result. The cause was the shared-fixture bug above, not the referral change;
merging `main` into the branch cleared it and all four checks then passed.

---

## Post-merge: test teardown fix (`fix/teardown-timeout`)

The full suite on merged `main` reported a failed *file* while all 209 tests
passed — `tests/credits/spend-race.test.ts`'s `afterAll` blew vitest's 10s hook
budget deleting its throwaway accounts one round-trip at a time. The timeout
aborts the loop partway, so the hook leaks exactly the accounts it exists to
remove, into the shared project, because **there is no staging database**.

Deletions are now parallel with an explicit 60s hook timeout, in that suite and
in `tests/api/rate-limit.test.ts` which had the same shape. Suite is 209/209
green.

Two orphaned accounts from earlier runs remain (`rls-*`, `employer-*`) against
7 real users. Not enough to slow anything; recorded so the number can be
watched rather than rediscovered.

## Environment variables the founder must set

Not code changes — these need someone with account access.

| Variable | Where | Why it matters now |
|----------|-------|--------------------|
| `INGEST_SECRET` | Vercel **Production** | **New and load-bearing after #37.** The admin routes now fail closed, which is the point — but every manual admin trigger answers 401 until this is set. Also needed in `.env.local`, because `npm run seed` drives the real ingestion route over HTTP. |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Vercel **Production** | Unconfirmed. Three crons now depend on it (job ingestion 05:00, Pass renewal 06:00, scholarship ingestion 07:00 UTC). No cron has ever been *observed* firing. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Vercel **Production** | The key on file is free-tier: 20 requests/day, shared. AI features hard-fail past that. |

Leaked-password protection remains a Supabase **dashboard-only** toggle with no
MCP or CLI path. Carried forward, deliberately not worked around.

## Missing input documents

The priority backlog dated 2026-08-25 refers to roughly fifty prompt files in
this directory. **None of the following exist** — checked in the repo root and
across `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents` and `~/Downloads`:

- `handoff-status.md` (this file now stands in for it)
- `schema-org-job-ingestion-prompt.md` — backlog item 2
- `test-scenarios-job-feed-matching-prompt.md`
- `test-scenarios-external-api-integrations-prompt.md`
- `test-scenarios-employer-prompt.md`
- `test-scenarios-scholarships-prompt.md`
- `test-scenarios-resume-builder-prompt.md`
- `test-scenarios-tailoring-credits-payments-prompt.md`
- `test-scenarios-auth-onboarding-prompt.md`
- `talentrah-gtm-brief.md`, `competitive-landscape-brief.html`,
  `pricing-validation-prep-prompt.md`

Present and readable: `CLAUDE.md`, `talentrah-build-prompt.md`,
`talentrah-editorial-design-handoff.md`, `Main-Editorial.dc.html`,
`JobFeed-Editorial.dc.html`, and the plan at
`~/.claude/plans/adaptive-giggling-ember.md`.

The backlog's one-line summaries of each missing brief are enough to *work
from* — but not enough to honour instructions like "read its §0/§1 before
touching a source," which for the schema.org brief carries the source-eligibility
rules. Those need the real files.

---

## Open backlog

1. ~~Merge #35, #36, #37~~ — **done**, verified above.
2. **schema.org/JobPosting ingestion** — not started. Blocked on the missing
   brief: three candidate sources were already ruled out and the reasons live
   in that file. Known from prior session context: `hotnigerianjobs.com` is
   disqualified outright (`robots.txt` names ClaudeBot/GPTBot/CCBot,
   `ai-train=no, use=reference`), `jobberman.com` disallows `/job/`, and
   `myjobmag.com` serves no JSON-LD. A fourth source has to be found and
   cleared first.
3. **Six remaining test-coverage briefs**, in the backlog's severity order.
   Also blocked on missing files, though the one-line summaries name the
   defects. Highest-value leads from those summaries:
   - Cross-source dedup hash collisions destroying a posting's apply link.
   - A transient empty-200 ingest response mass-closing a source's live postings.
   - A Paystack blip being indistinguishable from a real decline, permanently
     killing a paying customer's auto-renewal; **no external call anywhere sets
     a timeout**.
   - Duplicate org names/domains unguarded — the second owner's org becomes
     permanently unmanageable.
   - Premium-template gate bypassable via a direct `PATCH` to
     `resumes.template_id` — the same privilege-boundary class as 0028/0030/0031,
     and `resumes` was never swept for it.
   - A zero-width character defeating the "no name yet" guard, reopening the
     PR #21 bug through a character class `.trim()` does not cover.
   - `e2e/employer.spec.ts` flake — the concrete lead is a live-shared-database
     race between concurrent CI runs, not Playwright parallelism (the config
     already rules that out).

Items already closed that these briefs still describe as open — confirm, don't
re-diagnose: the ingestion trigger's fail-open (#37), the `spendCredits` race
and the scholarship credit try/catch gap (#34), and the resume-builder
credit-spend race (#34).
